## Weights
The trained weights for our models are crucial for the Magic Wand's performance. Download the weights for implementation [here](./weights).

## Arduino Code
The core of our project, the Arduino code, brings our Magic Wand to life. You can find the code and implementation details [here](./arduino).
Note: [arduino/model.h](arduino/model.h) is a float32 model. [arduino/quantized_model.h](arduino/quantized_model.h) is a quantized model in int8. The default model in [arduino/IMU_classifier.ino](arduino/IMU_classifier.ino) is the float32 model.
